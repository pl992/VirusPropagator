TODO Let people healing with a probability which decreases exponentially over time

Simulation details:

2D grid spacexspace representing the space

Each cell of the grid can be contaminated or not contaminated. After dt timesteps a cell is contaminated comes back to be not contaminated

It starts from a population of npeople people with one ninfected.

People are moving through random walks (dispacement defines the size of the motion)

If an infected person passes through a not contaminated cell the cell becomes contaminated, if it's already contaminated the timer of the contamination start over

If a person not infected passes through a contaminated cell has a probability of p_get_infected to get infected

After lifetime timesteps a person is infected is deleted from the list of people (and from the grid)
